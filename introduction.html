        Introduction of skills

        I started in computer engineering before switching to computer science. This means my first 2 languages were C and then C++. I also learned the hardware description
        language verilog. I then switched over to CS and learned Java and Python on the fly. I largely enjoy Python but really just avoid java whenever possible. I have taken 
        a few classes involving javascript but I would not consider myself adept.
        At my work I use C#. I had never used it before and largely enjoy it. I really like the LINQ library and the flexibility it adds to collections
